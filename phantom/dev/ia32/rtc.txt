(A little Mystery)

This article features CMOS, which is an interesting topic for the beginners and for virtually every programmer as CMOS stores the system settings even when you switch off the computer. Ever wondered how Operating system is able to tell you correct time and date even if you keep your computer off for months? All the required settings about FDD, HDD, timers, etc. are stored in a small capacity low powered memory called the CMOS.

In this article I present you with a basic knowledge of this memory area of your system, how to actually access this memory, a code segment in C and then a memory map of CMOS.

The CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) memory is 65 or 128 byte RAM which is powered by a battery on the motherboard.

The CMOS is actually out of range of normal address range and cannot be directly reached. It is accessed through IN and OUT commands which are used at ports 70h and 71h.

Because of the construction of the port 70, the CMOS RAM has an upper limit of 128 bytes. This is because only 7 bits i.e. bits 0-6 are used for addressing and the last bit i.e. bit 7 is used for Enabling or Disabling Non Maskable Interrupts (NMI), bit 7=0 Enable NMI, bit 7=1 Disable NMI

To access CMOS RAM, the index address (0 to 7F H) is output to port 70H, and the data is then read or written at port 71 H. Interrupts should be inhibited while the entire port 70 H /71 H sequence is completed. Alternatively, the port sequence can occur during an interrupt service routine before re-enabling interrupts. If these precautions are not observed, an interrupt service routine could potentially intervene between the output to port 70 H and the subsequent I/O to port 71 H, overwriting the port 70 H value.

/*Code segment in C for accessing CMOS*/

In the following function ReadFromCMOS we execute a loop for 128 times to read all the CMOS locations, each time we clear accumulator, disable interrupts, copy index of the byte to be read to lower byte of accumulator, provide index to port number 70h and then wait for the response to be provided on port 71h, we then copy value provided at port 71h and enable interrupts, this value is then stored in array.

ReadFromCMOS (unsigned char array [])
{
   int index;
   unsigned char tvalue, bindex;
   for(index = 0; index < 128; index++)
   {
      char AL_ = (unsigned char) index;
      _asm 
      {
         xor ax,ax       /* Clear accumulator*/
         cli             /* Disable interrupts*/
         mov al,AL_      /* Move index address*/
         out 0x70,al     /* Copy address to CMOS register*/
         nop
         nop
         nop             /* Wait a bit for response*/
         in al,0x71      /* Fetch 1 byte to al*/
         sti             /* Enable interrupts*/
         mov tvalue,al
       }
       array[index] = tvalue;
   }
}



In the following function WriteToCMOS we execute a loop for 128 times to write to all the CMOS locations, each time we take a byte from array. we clear accumulator, disable interrupts, copy index of the byte to be written to lower byte of accumulator, byte to be written to higher byte of accumulator, provide index to port number 70h and byte to be written on port 71h, we then enable interrupts.

WriteTOCMOS(unsigned char array[])
{
   unsigned char index;
   for(index = 0; index < 128; index++)
   {
      unsigned char tvalue = array[index];
      _asm 
      {
         xor ax,ax       /* zero register*/
         cli             /* Clear interrupts*/
         mov al,index    /* move index address*/
         mov ah,tvalue   /* copy value to ah*/
         out 0x70,al     /* copy address to CMOS register*/
         nop
         nop
         nop             /* Wait a bit */
         mov al,ah       /* move value to al*/
         out 0x71,al     /* write 1 byte to CMOS*/
         sti             /* Enable interrupts*/
      }
   }
}



On Linux, you must set the IO permission level (iopl) to read or write from those ports. Sample code for Linux:

/* (c) 2003 Ark Linux (http://www.arklinux.org/),
   released to the public domain */

   1. include <sys/io.h>

inline void cli() {
	asm("cli");
}
inline void sti() {
	asm("sti");
}
void setCmos(int reg, int value)
{
	outb_p(reg, 0x70);
	outb_p(value, 0x71);
}
int readCmos(int reg)
{
	outb_p(reg, 0x70);
	return inb_p(0x71);
}
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	iopl(3);
	cli();
	/* Use readCmos() and writeCmos() here */
	sti();
	iopl(0);
}



Below is a typical CMOS RAM memory map for an AT PC. Under a 128 byte ISA compatible CMOS, 16 bytes (00h-0fh) is the real time clock, 32 bytes (10h-2Fh) is the ISA configuration data, 16 bytes (30h-3Fh) is the BIOS specific configuration data and 64 bytes (40h-7Fh) is the ESCD (Extended System Configuration Data).
