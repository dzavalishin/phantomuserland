Running Phantom on QEMU
-----------------------

> cd ../run
> phantom_clean


Debugging on all platforms
--------------------------

- run kernel in qemu as said above
- cd trunk/oldtree/kernel/phantom
- run gdb (arm-elf-gdb/mips-elf-gdb)
- it will execute .gdbinit and connect to running kernel
- if you need to setup gdb to your needs, create/modify .gdb-local (doesn't work on arm for some reason)


Running Phantom on Intel 32
---------------------------

Phantom kernel on ia32 is a regular GRUB kernel. Any GRUB installation
will do. See run/fat/boot/menu.lst for examples.

Phantom will need two more things to run: own partition and initial VM classes.

Partition can be created with Unix partitioning programs and must have 
type 0xD3. See run/zero_ph_img.sh - it creates phantom.img file which
you will need to dd to created partition to format it.

Or just do:

> dd conv=notrunc bs=4096 count=1 seek=16 if=img/phantom.superblock of=/dev/...

Providing phantom with initial classes can be done in two ways:

1. 'classes' boot module. See menu.lst above for example. classes bundle
   is in run/fat/boot.

2. /class directory on first FAT partition available. Copy plib/bin/*.pc
   stuff to this directory.

Note that in both cases classes are loaded just on the first start of 
kernel - after snapshot all the loaded classes are frozen in snap. 


Running Phantom on ARM/MIPS
---------------------------

ARM and MIPS ports are not finished yet. Enable corresponding ARCH in
local-config.mk, "make clean all". See run/run_arm.cmd and run/run_mips.cmd 
to run on QEMU. Both kernels will die sooner or later. You're welcome to
help with these ports.


Running Phantom on Intel 64
---------------------------

This port is not producing bootable code yet. Again, don't hesitate to 
take part.


Running Phantom on Elbrus2K
---------------------------

This port is not producing bootable code yet. Please take part and help us.
