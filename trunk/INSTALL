0. You will need cygwin + QEMU on Windows (see etc/cygwin_get.cmd). On Linux/MacOS just QEMU is needed.

1. Set PHANTOM_HOME env var to point to this directory.

2. Edit config.mk

3. make install

4. cd run; phantom.cmd/phantom.sh.

See doc/RUNNING for more details.

For Windows-based Phantom code test and debug the path is:

1. Make sure you have all classes you import compiled in plib/bin. Just
   come to that dir and make. No dependencies are set up between .pc 
   files so, it is possible, you will need to make 3 or 4 times of compile
   some .ph files yourself. Use "plc file.ph" to compile .ph source file.
   Result comes to plib/bin automatically.

2. Make sure you have "classes" file made in plib/bin. Just "make" after
   all the required .pc files are there.

3. Run pvm_test.exe. See ru.dz.phantom.system.boot.ph to understand
   startup sequence.
