Refactoring of old Phantom compiler and Java to Phantom convertor



Building
--------

It is supposed that you use Eclipse to work with java sources. mkjar script builds binary and puts it 
to buld direftory to be used by plc command.



Regress tests
-------------

If working with compiler please run regress tests in /test/plc.

Make sure you executed mkjar.cmd/.sh before so that tests will use your new compiler binaries.



Java to Phantom convertor
-------------------------

based on Soot framework as .class file parser and Phantom language compiler's
codegen as output. Mostly - mapping from soot output to phantom code 
internal representation (tree).

NB. Direct access to class field in java is not supported in Phantom. Generate getters?

To run Java unit tests in Phantom uncomment calls in ru.dz.phantom.system.boot.ph - see .test.toPhantom.AllRun
